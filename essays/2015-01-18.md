## Javascript Babysteps
Prior to being introduced to Javascript with the introduction exercises and ES6 I was only familiar with Java and C/C++. I really enjoyed working through FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to JavaScript as it helped a lot with learning the basics of Javascript and really going through things step by step. It made it really easy to get into Javascript and transition into the slighty more advanced topics having a good grasp on the basics. When going through the ES6 problems they seemed pretty straight forward at first with things being more open and variables and functions being more flexible than in other languages like Java. I believe that, in this aspect especially, Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective as it gives more freedom as long as you are careful about what you are doing. 

## Stress Testing the Brain
Personally, I really like the concept of WODs and believe that they are a great way to test and sharpen my software engineering skills. Aside from coding I really enjoy working out and believe that the same principles that apply to working out are great for growth when applied to something like software engineering. The time aspect adds an extra level of stress and urgency where you really need to understand the material and how the software will work to succeed. In the past, there were always deadlines for the problems given but they were never urgent like the WODs and I feel like it is really interesting look at the speed at which you can problem solve as opposed to just if you can solve the problem over time. I believe that putting yourself and your brain under that extra stress can really help you to grow, prepare better for the next time, and lead to many benefits in the long run.
