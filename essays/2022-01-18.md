## Javascript Babysteps
In the past couple of years, I have mainly learned and worked with Java and C/C++ which has got me more and more interested in computer science as a whole. Although Javascript is new to me, I really enjoyed working through FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to JavaScript as I feel it helped tremendously with truly understanding the basics of Javascript by going through things step by step regardless of how tedious it may seem. It made it very easy to get into Javascript and transition into the slighty more advanced topics through having a good grasp on the basics. When working through the ES6 problems they seemed pretty straight forward at first and I loved that things seemed more open with variables and functions being more flexible than in other languages like Java. As the problems went on and they became more complicated I definetly had to take time to stop and think but I found it very satisfying being able to complete them having just picked up the language recently. I believe that, in the flexibility aspect especially, Javascript is a great programming language from a software engineering perspective as it gives more freedom given you are careful about what you are doing. There is a lot of potential with Javascript and I am very excited to learn more about it in the near future.

## Stress Testing the Brain
Personally, I really like the concept of WODs and believe that they are a great way to test and sharpen my software engineering skills. Aside from coding I really enjoy working out and believe that the same principles that apply to working out are great for growth when applied to something like software engineering. The time aspect adds an extra level of stress and urgency where you really need to understand the material and how the software will work to succeed. In the past, there were always deadlines for the problems given but they were never urgent like the WODs and I feel like it is really interesting look at the speed at which you can problem solve as opposed to just if you can solve the problem over time. I believe that putting yourself and your brain under that extra stress can really help you to grow, prepare better for the next time, and lead to many benefits in the long run.
