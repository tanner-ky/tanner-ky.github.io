## M

Throughout this semester in ICS 414, I've grown a lot as a software engineer in both my coding mechanics and my ability to interact and work with teammates as well as customers. During this course I worked with my team to develop a bill tracker that could be used for both the Department of Education and the University of Hawaii. I learned and experimented with new tools in javascript that enabled me and my teammates to create an efficient and functional web page. Along with the new skills I attained, I believe that this course helped a lot with strengthening skills I had previously learned, in terms of web development, and allowed me to refine them as well as prove I could apply previous knowlegde to a new project.

## Working in a Large Group

This was my first experience working in a large group of 10+ members and it was a very informative experience. I quickly learned the importance of communicating with your group members effectively to make sure everyone is on the same page. Another takeaway from this experience is that there will be problems that come up; this includes things like group members getting sick or overlapping commits. My group found that the best thing to do when problems arise is to communicate it to the other group members, as quickly as possible, and try to find a solution that is agreed upon. Working in a group of this size has many upsides as well, in that you can a get a large amount of work done in a short amount of time through the appropriate distribution of tasks. Individually, I did my best to communicate with my group members in a timely manner because I know how frustrating it can be having to wait for others to continue or complete the task you're working on. One last very important thing that I came away with is to ask for help from your teammates when you need it, sooner rather than later. The great thing about working in a group is that everyone brings their own skillset and background, meaning they may be able to help you with certain aspects of your code development that you aren't as familiar with.

## Working for Someone

This was also my first experience working for a customer and having to communicate our progress back and forth to compare it to their needs and expectations. Previous major projects that I've worked on were more flexible in that the features of the program or website were largely up to me. It was a lot more challenging to be given a list of faults and inconveniences with their previous bill tracking system and having to find our own ways to solve them.
