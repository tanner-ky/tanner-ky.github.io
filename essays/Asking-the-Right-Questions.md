## The Fundamentals

The ability to ask a good question and clearly convey what you are trying to achieve is very overlooked. There are a lot of things to take into account when asking a question that greatly increase the chances of recieving a helpful and timely response. The first thing to do before asking a question is to try to find the answer on your own. Whether is be through things like the web or an educated friend, it is more often than not someone has had the same question in the past or the answer is already out there. Two more very important things to consider when actually starting to post the question is to find the most relevant forum to post on and using meaniful and specific subject headers. This is key so that your question can reach the desired as well as most qualified audience to give you an accurate response. Lastly, when typing out your question or code make sure it is written clearly, is grammatically correct, and is precise and informative to avoid the confusion of readers. These are the fundamentals for asking a good question and have a huge impact on the quality and potentially the availability of answers. I believe communication is a key aspect for life in general and applies heavily to software engineering.
