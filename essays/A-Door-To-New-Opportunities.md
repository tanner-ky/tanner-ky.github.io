## My First Impressions

Honestly, my intial thoughts on RadGrad were that it was going to be another simple college pathway planner that wouldn't be too interesting. However, while working through the tutorial I realized that it actually has a lot to offer in terms of detailed descriptions of the oppurtunities for computer science students. I really like the fact that there are brief descriptions for each extracurricular along with links that allow you to learn even more if you so wish. There are definitely a lot more opportunities out there than I was previously aware of and I appreciate that they are very specialized; allowing you to focus on things you're actually interested in. RadGrad also opened my eyes to the immense range of computer science in that there are so many different and unique jobs within it. Overall, I was skeptical at first glance but quickly realized RadGrad can be very beneficial for me.

## New Opportunities and Experiences

Prior to signing up for RadGrad, I had not heard of a majority of the opportunities listed. There are a lot of global, as well as local, opportunities that look very interesting to me and fit well with my goals. This applies a lot to the game design opportunites like "Learn Unity" as gaming has always peaked my interest and has played a fairly significant role in my life. I also noticed some programs are run by professors I have had in the past like Professor Peter Sadowski which was cool to see. Aside from the actual opportunities themselves, I really admire the ability to connect that RadGrad provides. I find it awesome that it allows you to view which of your peers are interested in similar topics or programs and I believe it could lead to genuine connections in the future. One more thing I found very intriguing is the innovation, competency, and experience levels. The fact that RadGrad is pushing students to push themselves in all aspects of computer science is very awesome to me. 

## Outlook for the Future

Although I was a little overwhelemed with the amount of different opportunites that are pressent, I will definitely be looking to take advantage of as many as possible in the near future. I have been reading up on some game development and career opportunites since signing up for RadGrad and am excited to see more of what they have to offer. I'm not entirely sure how much of an impact RadGrad will have on my actual path to a degree as I don't picture many of my classes changing. But, it will definitely have an impact on the amount of experience I have by the time I recieve my degree; given the amount of information it has on knowledge outlets. In the upcoming summer and semesters, I'm planning to participate in at least a few computer science programs, listed on RadGrad, to gain that extra experience and set myself up for success post-college.
