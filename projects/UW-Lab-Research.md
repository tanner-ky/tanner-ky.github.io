For 8 weeks, in Summer 2018, I worked in a lab at the University of Washington, Department of Pharmacology under Chris Hague, Ph.D. and Dorathy-Ann Harris, Ph.C.. I conducted research pertaining to generating stable cell lines that would express the Somatostatin Receptor 2 or SSTR2 which is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the body. It inhibits the release of hormones throughout many areas of the body such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and kidneys. During this time, I had to work with one of my peers and the other researchers to complete the experiment and collect accurate data. 

There were many steps in this process including the transfection, maintaining, splitting, and harvesting of cells. After these processes I ran the proteins of the cell through a gel to determine if they had the desired receptor. This was a long and tedious process spanning over 8 weeks that culminated in a 10-15 minute presentation and a six page paper detailing the experiment and the results. I think this experience relates to software engineering in that some of the same principles are very key to success. Theres needs to be a clear understanding of the material and the ability to stick to the format or rules to make sure that the experiment is valid. Overall, this was a great experience for me being able to live on my own and work around real Ph.D.s while conducting important research.
