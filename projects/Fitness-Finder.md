For my final project in ICS 314, I worked with a team to develop a webpage that enables students to find other members of the University of Hawaii community to workout and stay active with. We used IntelliJ and Github to collaborate on the project, working off of the bowfolios template provide by Professor Philip Johnson. This final project was a demonstration of the many skills and concepts gained throughout ICS 314 including agile project management, coding standards, as well and frontend and backend development. The main roles that I had throughout the project included creating the footer and header for the webpage, creating testcafe cases for the display and functionality of each page, deployment of the webpage, default database management, as well as setting a secure URL to access the page. 

## Personal Takeaways
My biggest takeaway from working on this project is that organization is key in making progress as a team. This is why agile project development, specifically issue driven project management, was so crucial in creating a quality finished product for our final project. Issue driven project management really ensures that each group member is on the same page and progress can be made smoothly. I also gained a lot of knowledge on how webpages work in terms of display, testing, and deployment. There was a lot of time and testing required to make sure that the functionality of each individual page was as intended. At first, I thought this project would be very difficult but found that I am capable of doing more, in a software engineering sense, than I previously believed possible. Through working as a team, we didn't have to cut any corners and were able to develop the webpage, along with all the functionalities, as we had originally envisioned.
